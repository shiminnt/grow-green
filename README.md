## About GrowGreen

GrowGreen is an all-rounded approach that aims to increase awareness and educate users about the environment and climate change so as to inspire users to do their part to take actionable steps towards saving the environment. Through fun and interactive ways, GrowGreen serves as an educational platform for users to learn about environmental issues around the world. Furthermore, it allows users to stay updated with current environmental news and provides tips on how users can help to save the environment and fun facts one would not typically know about the Earth. Lastly, GrowGreen ultimately aims to plant a seed in every user to care about the environment, hence it provides a platform for users to take tangible action by signing up for volunteering events to do their part to protect the environment. With a centralised website with different types of environmental volunteering opportunities, GrowGreen serves as a one-stop platform for users to get key information on various events in need of volunteers, motivating and encouraging them to start their journey to contribute to the environment. This awareness is important to increase enthusiasm and support, stimulate self-mobilisation and action, and mobilise local knowledge and resources.
